          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>
            In this information techological era, one has to be very much aware about what information has to be consumed and try to understand all aspects of the inforamation being provided. Most of the information that we consume is flawed. 
          </p>

          <p>Can you figure out what's wrong/hidden with the information that you are consuming? Mostly not!.</p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different approach that focuses on covering neglected aspects of the problems and contribute my bit for the problems that our world and India in particular faces today.</p>

          <p>I wanted to namy this website www.problems.com but rather i chose to name it hasteee (speed), its time to take
          speedy actions, rather looping around with the discussions.</p>

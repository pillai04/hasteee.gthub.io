          <h1>Do you really think that a little virus can kill you. Yes it can, but wouldn’t you like to fight back ?</h1>
          <p> Was only COVID-19 alone responsible for people dying. No, there were many other factors and one of the major 	was poor health infrastructure.
		   But the other factor was people’s psychology towards this pandemic. </p>

  		<p> Before i dive deep into the article. Please ask yourself, wouldn’t it be great if there was some MASK sort of thing to protect your brain from the virus that is long standing out to enter into your brain and take control of your thoughts.
  		</p>
  		<p style="text-decoration: underline;">
		Brain create thoughts by analyzing the situation within your body and beyond as well, thoughts in return create emotions and control your brain’s activity. So, the brain which was initially responsible for thought generation is no more doing so. Cycle is reversed and now emotions are controlling the thought generation process. Original process is infected and now is causing you to think more and more, which creates emotional instability and diverts your thinking into the most negative aspect of the situation you are in. And you are STUCK !!
		</p>
		<p> Now you may think who am i to put such a claim. I’m not graduated from any of the courses that medical science has to offer, neither i am going to enroll in any. Then How ?
		</p>
		I lost two relatives in this pandemic not because of Covid but of psychological disturbance that they had to go through.
		But below is the story to learn why psychology is most important factor above all.
		<p>
		This is a story of a relative who was an advocate in Supreme Court of India. He had two sons, his elder son runs a big private firm of advocates in USA, and the younger one is a practising lawyer in SC-India. His eldest son had no touch with him and the other was living with him but gave zero importance to him. Uncle was already sick and was going under treatment since January but in May he was infected with the Virus and was going under home  treatment. When his condition started deteriorating, my aunt called ambulance. Ambulance took more than 1 hour to get there but this is not something that i have to highlight. Most importantly when ambulance arrived it didn’t came to the door of uncle’s home, it stood by the end of the lane (around 500m ) because lane was isolated by barricading using bamboos. So he had to be carried by people to the ambulance. Shockingly his own son denied touching him — Trauma Hit 1. </p>
		<p>So his neighbors came forward and carried him to ambulance. Basically he was dragged from his home, no wheel chair, no stretcher — Trauma Hit 2. </p>
		<p>Such mis-handling is a traumatic experience for patient and to the family as well. Now he was in the ambulance, and for the next 5 hours he didn’t get bed in any of the hospitals — Trauma Hit 3.</p> 
		<p>While my aunt alone was trying to arrange a bed and was inside in one of the hospitals, uncle gained consciousness and asked someone, have you seen my wife. The person responded with a no and told him that your family has abandoned you because of the fear of Covid -19 — Trauma Hit 4. </p>
		<p>Hearing this he was shocked. And he was numb from that very moment. When my aunt arrived he simply asked her to take him home. He told her if these are my last moments i want to be at a place which i have built from my sweat and love, i don't want to die at a hospital bed. He gave up. He died at his home after 5 days and not because of Covid but because he lost his appetite.
		</p>
		<p>
		He died because of a traumatic experience that he had to go through. He didn’t fought back. Sadly Mental toughness is not a subject in school or colleges. The basic tool for survival is missing. </p>
		<p>
		Conclusion:</p>
		<p>
		Why talking about psychology is important?
		</p>
		<p>
		Do i really need to tell you this? Ask yourself, when was the last time you got into a fight or into an argument and took a long breath to silence the chatter of your head. And it actually helped to calm you.
		Yep! you got it right. You silenced your brain. Ordered it to shush.
		And if not tried this, from next time whenever stuck somewhere, say it out loud:
		Silencio Bruno(refer to your brain by a giving it a nickname, in this case Bruno)
		Psychology can do magic, it gives us a completely different idea of something we think we know best.</p>
